narrative/the problem

I sit down at my desk in front of my pc, and open my game library to locate a game to play. There are way too many games and I am not sure what kind of game I'm in the mood for. Some games I have forgotten about since they are hidden within the entire folder of games.

test

I open up my game library and then my app, and I can see my favorite games, as well as other games sorted, which is more pleasant and enjoyable. I can edit the games to a completed page, or simply browse through any genre. Others can also use the app to insert their games and sort them into categories. The app has links to related resources.
